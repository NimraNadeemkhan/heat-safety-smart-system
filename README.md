<summary><h2>🔥 1. Safety Twin — Worker Safety Console (Full-Stack & Real-Time) 🌡️</h2></summary>

💡 Problem Statement

In industrial or construction environments, workers face critical, often invisible, risks from high heat and humidity, leading to heat-stress injuries, reduced productivity, and potentially fatal incidents. Traditional safety checks are manual and reactive, failing to provide the real-time, predictive insight required to prevent dangerous working conditions before symptoms manifest.

🎯 Solution

The Safety Twin system is a predictive, real-time safety console that uses IoT data fusion and 3D Digital Twin visualization to actively monitor and forecast risk. It translates raw environmental and physiological data into a simple, color-coded health status on a live 3D model, allowing safety managers to take immediate, preemptive action, thus shifting the safety paradigm from reactive incident response to proactive risk mitigation.
