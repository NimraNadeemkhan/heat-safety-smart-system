[6:06 PM, 11/28/2025] Nimra Khan: # Safeguard Twin — Worker Safety Console 🌡️
*Real-Time Biometric & Environmental Monitoring System*

Safeguard Twin is a full-stack worker-safety monitoring dashboard combining *IoT data, **heat-stress analytics, **predictive environmental metrics, and a **live digital twin robot* that visually reacts to risk levels.

This project demonstrates:
- Real-time data handling  
- Node.js backend  
- Frontend dashboard visualization  
- Predictive modeling  
- Safety automation logic  
- Interactive digital-twin visualization
